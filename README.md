## Shift Exchange for Disney World Cast Members

### Overview
This page is designed to be an alternative to facebook for giving shifts away for Disney Cast Members at Walt Disney World.

### Why

Facebook is a great place to connect with friends and family, but the groups that are created to share shifts are lacking a primal function of being able to see the shifts clearly. Users of facebook will post a shift with text or graphic only to find their post subject of the facebook algorithms and possibly hidden or suppressed due to unpopularity. Posts are not easily searchable and often go unnoticed. More and more people are seeing the damages that social media has on their well-being or do not like the "big-tech" aspect of facebook and choose not to use it if they are able to avoid it. WDWShiftX will give users a better place to post shifts and connect with co-workers. No other distractions and the page is all-inclusive.
