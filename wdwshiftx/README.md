# ShiftX a better way to share and trade shifts

This project is intended to replace the facebook alternatives for posting available shifts and trading them with others.

## Problems with the current solution

Facebook is the current choice for Disney Cast Members to post shifts and trade with fellow CM's. The major issue with Facebook groups is that shifts get lost in the shuffle of other shifts and unrelated posts in the group news feed. Another issue is that people tend to post shifts with either a picture or with text that follows no uniform structure making it hard to found in the sea of other posts. Too rare, will someone delete their post after the shift has been traded or given away. The news feed is littered with irrelevant, out-outdated posts. Lastly, Facebook has come under fire for political sensorship and being linked to depression in its users, causing many to abandon their accounts.

## The Solution in ShiftX

ShiftX gives people a place to share shifts with one another without the fluff or distractions of facebook. The simple design is available on mobile devices as well as desktops. Shifts are easly displayed in a table like form with all the needed information. CM's can still form their own groups for posting shifts, so they won't see shifts from every line of business or even every location.

### Upcoming Features
1. Multiple Groups' Shifts integrated into one table for the user
2. Calendar View to see shifts in a month calendar
3. Text messages when a shift is posted that meets your requirements
4. Profile pages with user images
5. Chats for each group to post fun things that are not shifts
